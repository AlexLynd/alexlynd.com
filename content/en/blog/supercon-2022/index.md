### Supercon 2022
I've attended a handful of hacker conferences around the country, 

### Cat-Themed Soldering Workshop
I develop a cat-shaped hacking console called the [Nugget](), which comes in a cute, easy-to-assemble form-factor.  I designed this project as fun way to teach beginners about CyberSecurity and Hardware Prototyping through an interactive, gamified interface.

Over the past year, I've been working on refining this product, and using my workshops as a testground for new have prototyped everything from WiFi attack software to USB attacks on it. 

For this workshop, I focused on Keystroke Injection attacks, a fun and responsive way that beginners can try out security.
