This is the source code for my personal website.  The website is hosted on my Raspberry Pi, and uses the Dataplicity remote IOT management service to control it, and host the website with a .dataplicity.io domain.  I pointed a .tk domain to it, which is now alexlynd.tk.  I plan on updating the website soon to move away from this service.
