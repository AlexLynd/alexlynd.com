			Quite a while back I bought myself the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/73" target= "_blank">Adafruit TV-B-Gone kit</a>, which can turn off a whole range of TV brands, at the press of a button.  
			Unfortunately, my soldering skills were not on point at that time, and I forget what had happened then, but it did not function.  I removed the ATTINY,
			which still had the code flashed to it, and so, I set out to create my own TV-B-Gone clone, with a few modifications.

			<h3>Overview:</h3>
			<p>The TV-B-Gone is intended to be a universal "turn off remote" that can be used to shut off TVs.  TV remotes generally use IR LEDs to produce certain
			wavelengths in the IR spectrum of light, which the TV picks up and decodes as various instructions, such as turning volume up.  The "light" produced by
			IR is not visible to human eyes.  Basically, the TV-B-GONE has a list of all the turn off codes for multiple TV brands, and will brute force test all of
			them until the TV is turned off.  I made no change to the code, but replaced various hardware.  For example, I wanted something lightweight, so instead
			of the bulky battery pack, I added a rechargeable Li-Po battery with a charging circuit, and swapped out some trivial things like transistor models. 
			However, I did make a model with the battery pack, which I gave to a friend.</p>

			<h3>Project Log:</h3>
			<p>Initially I drew a schematic of the circuitry, based off this one <a href="">provided by Adafruit</a>.</p>
			<p>I scaled my perf board down to the size of the battery pack, by tracing it first, etching into those lines, and snapping off the edges.</p>
			<p>I then marked up the perf. board with a Sharpie to layout the components, and drew the solder traces to make sure there was no interference.</p>
			<p>After, I got to soldering.  I first placed the DIP-8 socket down.</p>
