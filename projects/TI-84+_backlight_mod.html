			Have you ever wanted to <del>do your math homework</del>  play Super Mario on your calculator in the dark?  Now you're in luck.
			I had initially intended to create this project using an <a href= "https://www.adafruit.com/product/625" target="_blank">EL pannel</a> 
			and a small <a href= "https://www.adafruit.com/product/1350" target="_blank">inverter</a> like Tyler Anderson did 
			<a href= "https://hackaday.io/project/60-ti-84-se-backlight" target="_blank">here</a>, but found an old iPhone sitting around that I 
			could take apart.  Just before buying the parts, I took apart my friend's iPhone, and found a small diffusive plastic film and some 
			micro LEDs that acted as the phone backlighting, and then I realized that I could repurpose my old, broken iPhone to give my calculator
			some light.  It was given to me by a friend, and I had intents on fixing on it, but the calculator was a priority.

			<h3>Materials:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>TI-84+</li>
				<li>iPhone Backlight</li>

			<h3>Instructions:</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Start by taking apart the calculator:  I have a guide <a href "test">here</a>, you will need a Torx T6 bit and some other parts.</li>
				<li>Carefully remove the motherboard using the documented process, removing the excess plastic and so forth.</li>
				<li>Ignore these following steps if you just bought the diffusive backlight.</li>
