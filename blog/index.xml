Using a technique called WarDriving, we wanted to create a proof-of-concept that allows someone to detect potential stalkers - by seeing if a creepy WiFi-enabled device (like a smartphone), is spotted at multiple unique GPS coordinates trailing them.
What is WarDriving?</description></item><item><title>Build a DIY TV-B-Gone for $15</title><link>https://alexlynd.com/blog/build-a-diy-tv-b-gone-for-15/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jun 2019 22:18:47 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://alexlynd.com/blog/build-a-diy-tv-b-gone-for-15/</guid><description>What is a TV B Gone? # The TV-B-Gone is a universal &amp;ldquo;remote&amp;rdquo; created by Mitch Altman that can turn off almost any TV in a ~150 foot range. This works by blasting a curated list of infrared light (IR) turn-off codes from various TV manufacturers at the target device, until one of them is successful.
You can buy the original TV-B-Gone on their website, or pick up an awesome DIY Kit from Adafruit that also supports the open-source project!</description></item></channel></rss>
